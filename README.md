# Heurestic-Algorithm

Heuristic Algorithm is a technique used to solve problems quickly.
Non-polynomial problems have time complexity in exponential.
It will definitely give us optimal solution but it Weill take more time.
Heuristic algorithm will give always good solution but optimal solution may or maynâ€™t come  out of many solutions which will reduce time.
It is used to solve np problems in polynomial time hence quickly.

A Heuristic (or a heuristic function) takes a look at search algorithms. At each branching step, it evaluates the available information and makes a decision on which branch to follow. It does so by ranking alternatives. The Heuristic is any device that is often effective but will not guarantee work in every case.
